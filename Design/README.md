# Good Design Practices

This topic will be covered in several different sessions:

1. Open Discussion on Good Design Practices
     - Use EasyRetro in [this board](https://easyretro.io/publicboard/Gomh5KbgSgWWelWjDLndgHGYohW2/c6383824-a972-4adf-a82b-9e5b873866dc) to facilitate an open discussion on good design practices.
    - Use the discussion points from the retro board to create R/Python and SQL guidelines that we all agree to adhere to.
2. Copy an existing repository known to have poor code design into a folder in this directory in a feature branch. Put in a merge request and let everyone comment through the merge request process what their feedback would be for improving the design (or redoing it from scratch) using on th instructions below. Regroup for a discussion.


## Design Activity Instructions

This Design folder contains a directory of working code for a recent version of an actual company product.vPlease think of this folder as a stand alone repository for the exercise described below.

Use the merge request of the `design_feedback` branch, which only contains this folder, into the `main` branch as an opportunity to practice giving feedback through code review. You may safely assume this is working code already so please place the emphasis of your code review on examining the design of this code, rather than if it is working or not.

*This exercise is not meant to be a **shit-fest** on anyone who worked on this code base previously so please make sure your feedback is tone appropriate as you would with any other code review.* That being said, this code base was specifically chosen for this exercise because almost every line of code was written by someone who is no longer with this company so there should be no fear of anyone's feelings being hurt by this exercise.
