# Good Design Practices

This topic will be covered in several different sessions:

1. Open Discussion on Good Design Practices using EasyRetro in [this board](https://easyretro.io/publicboard/Gomh5KbgSgWWelWjDLndgHGYohW2/c6383824-a972-4adf-a82b-9e5b873866dc).
2. Use the discussion points from the retro board above to create R/Python and SQl guidelines that we all agree to adhere to.
3. Copy an existing repository known to have poor code design into a folder in this directory in a feature branch. Put in a merge request and let everyone comment through the merge request process what their feedback would be for improving the design (or redoing it from scratch).
